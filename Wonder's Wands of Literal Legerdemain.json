Any property of an absorbed wand that would result in the wand's destruction, loss of a feature, permanent change into another item, or any other effect that would harm or change the integrity of the wand is not transferred.",
				"To magically absorb a wand into this one requires a number of dedicated hours spent in meditation with the two items based on the rarity of the other wand: 1 hour for common wands, 2 for uncommon, 3 for rare, 4 for very rare, 5 for legendary, and 6 for artifacts.",

If the feature had a roll upon using it's last charge to determine its fate, that roll and possible result are ignored."
